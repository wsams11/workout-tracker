Are you a movie critic?
Does not matter, come share your opinion on the movies you watch!

## Motivation

We created YouCritic as a way for people to see movie trailers and be able to rate movies and see what others have rated the movie!

## Features

YouCritic has some amazing features such as on the home page, you will be able to see the latest movies from release date, trending movies on most searched and all movies sorted by genre!

## Installation

## API Reference

- [THE MOVIE DATABASE API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)

YouCritic is based around our API call to The Movie Database API. On the home page, all the different sections are being pulled by the API call referencing each different section. When you are searching for a movie, the API call will display all the movies that fit the search term. On the movie detail page, you will see related movies to the movie selected which is also an API call!  

## Tests

The type of testing we used was a canary test. A "canary" test is one we set up to always pass, this can help us ensure our testing suite is set up correctly before writing real tests.
